# VividSeatsCodeChallenge
For Step 1: Please review VividSeatsCodeChallenge_ER_Diagram.png for the datamodel diagram

For Step 2: File VividSeatsChallenge_InstallationScript.sql can be executed in a server with SQL Server installed, this script will create the database, tables, relationships and populate the tables.

I included file VividSeatsChallenge_Queries.sql to perform some queries over the new database based on the scenarios provided.
